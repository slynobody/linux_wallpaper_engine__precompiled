## error: 'wallpaper not found'
wpe should be installed in one of these places
> ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common
> 
> ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common
> 
> ~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common
> 
> ~/snap/steam/common/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common

if installed elsewere, do a symlink of the 'asset'-folder to /usr/local/bin/wpe & run wpe by folder
> ./linux-wallpaperengine --screen-root eDP-1 ~/backgrounds/1845706469/

## error: Failed to initialize GLEW: Unknown error
just ignore (wayland *is* supported): working wallpapers should simply show up (web-wallpapers have errors).
